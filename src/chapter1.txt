 1.1.INTRODUCTION
This chapter gives the foundation of discrete mathematics. Much of discrete 
mathematics is devoted to the study of discrete structures, which are used to 
represent discrete objects. All discrete structures are built up from sets, which 
are collection of objects, used extensively in counting ; relations, which are 
set of ordered pairs that represent relationships between objects ; graphs, 
which are set of vertices & connected edges.
   In this chapter we cover some of the basic set languages and notations 
that will be used throughout the text. Venn diagrams will be introduced in 
order to give clear picture of set theory.

 1.2. SYMBOLS AND NOTATIONS
Following are the special symbols to denote the sets which will be used very 
often in the text.
    N Set of natural numbers 
    Z Set of integers
    Q Set of rational numbers
    R Set of real numbers
    C Set of complex numbers

1.3. SET
A set is a collection of well defined objects. The objects that constitute a set 
are called elements or members of the set.
    Usually set is denoted by capital letters A, B, C, and its elements
are denoted by lower case letters a, b, c, For example, if A is any set
having elements x1, x2, x3 then we write
                        A = {x1, x2, x3}
    If an element x is in the set A or belongs to the set A then it is denoted 
by x E A otherwise x e A.
    For example : x1 E A but a e A
    Usually sets are denoted by two ways : One way is to define a set by 
listing the elements and the second way is to state those properties which 
characterise the elements in the set.
EXAMPLE 1.1. If X is the set having four elements say 2, 4, 6, 8 then x can 
be given by;
               X = {x I x is an even positive integer less than 10}
           or
               X = {2, 4, 6, 8}
    Here first way is by defining the property and the second way is by listing 
the elements.
    Subsets : Let X and Y be two sets. If every element of the set Xis also 
the element in Y then X is called subset of Y and is denoted by X c Y, and 
it means either Xis in Y or X equals to Y. If Xis not equal to Y then Xis called 
proper subset or trivial of Y and is denoted by X c Y.
EXAMPLE 1.2. X = set of natural numbers = {xl x o N}
               Y = set of integers = {y I y E Z}
    then X c Y
EXAMPLE 1.3. X= {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
               Y = 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8}
    then X c Y
    Equal sets : Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have same 
elements & is denoted by A = B.
    For example A = 2, 3}, B = {x E NI1 x 3}
    then A = B.

EXAMPLE 1.4. X={x:x2-3x+2=0}
            Y = {1, 2}

            Z {1,2,5 15
   It is notable in the example (1.4) that all the above three sets are equal, 
therefore, the set does not depend on the way in which its elements are displayed.

   Do not use {4)} because this means the set containing the null set 4). The 
null set is a subset of every set.
                c A means X E 4)-4 XEA
   This is true by default.
Power Set :
   Power set of A is the set of all subsets of A, called P(A). So if we are given 
            B = {a, b, c,
              = 14), {a}, {b},{c},{d}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d},{b,c},{b,d}, 
          AB)   {c,c1},{a,b,c}, {a, b,d},{b,c,c1}, {a, b,c,d}
   There are 24 subsets in a power set, where n represents the number of sets 
in the original set. Cardinality of a set in the number of members in a set, if that 
number is a non-negative integer.
   The cardinality of B:
              I BI =4
Note:            =2181
   Proper subset—a subset which is not equal to the original set. 
              A cB

  1.4. MULTI-SETS AND MULTIPLICITY
If a set contains exactly m distinct elements where m denotes some non- 
negative integers, then the set is said to be a finite set otherwise the set is 
said to be an infinite set.
   For example, the set {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} is a finite set whereas N, the set of 
natural number is infinite set.
   As we have discussed above that we can define a set by different ways. 
Now, we define a multiset which is used to define a collection of objects which 
are not necessarily distinct.
   For example {1, 1, 2, 2, 2}, {a, b, c}, { }, {1, 1} are all multisets.
   Multiplicity of a Set : Number of times an element appearing in a set 
is called multiplicity of that element. As in the above first example {1, 1, 2, 
2, 2} multiplicity of 1 is 2 & multiplicity of 2 is 3.
   Definition : The sum of the multiplicities of the elements in the sets 
P and Q is denoted by multiplicity in the set P + Q.
EXAMPLE 1.5. Let P = {a, a, b, b, c}
